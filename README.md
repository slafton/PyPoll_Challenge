# Election Audit

## Overview of Election-Audit
#### We were tasked with seeing if it was possible to automate the election audit process with Python. The Board of Elections sent data from the Colorado Board of Elections in a CSV file for analysis. The hope is that this will be successful and that the code will be able to be refactored for other election audit processes.

## Election-Audit Results
   - 369,711 votes were cast in the congressional election.
   - Breakdown of votes per county
      - Jefferson had 38,855 votes which was 10.5%
      - Denver had 306,055 which was 82.8%
      - Arapahoe had 24,801 votes which was 6.7%
   - Denver County had the largest number of votes.
   - Breakdown of votes per candidate
      - Charles Casper Stockham had 85,213 votes which was 23.0%
      - Diana DeGette had 272,892 votes which was 73.8%
      - Raymon Anthony Doane had 11,606 votes which was 3.1%
   - Diana Degette won the election with 272,892 votes which was 73.8% of the total votes.

## Election-Audit Summary
#### This code can easily be refactored to be used for any election. Python is able to handle large amounts of data and is easy to use thanks to it's built in libraries. You could use the refactored election code for state election audits easily by declaring new variables and refactoring existing for and if statements. The results can easily be printed to a txt file.
